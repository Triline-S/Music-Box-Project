three leves of the dreams relam

Lucid/conscious 
inconcious 
limbo

three main mechanism that represent these leves

a big roulette, when u play the result shows on monitor, telling prophecy: it might be right or not, but that’s it 

about the accordion theme, I imagine a wide room with as background any sorts of strange mechanism, bellows and furnaces at work 

your purpose on life 

world is coming to end, people can’t heal it neither escape on other planets, but there’s another option: let the planet die and refuge in dreams. It’s not a valid solution, it only permits the earth to live without its biggest enemy: humans. All people are sleeping, so they aren’t consuming any natural products, the planet can maybe recover, but something is still needed to keep humans dreaming. 
Who controls that, which are his powers, where does he come from? and who created him?

Morpheus is the dreams ruler, Virgilium the guide in the deepest chasms, Satan live in ice waiting his vengeance, are you sure that this hell is just a nightmare? 
Live your dream as if it were your last, you don’t want to wake up, right? 

Can dreams be the escape? Or that's only a way to refuse and avoid life's pain that can't resolve anything?
